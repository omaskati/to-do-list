# to-do-list

An Odin Project assignment

The goal with making this to-do list app is two-fold:

1) To create an efficient, aesthetic to-do list app for my portfolio that will display my coding/design skills.
   * It may not be the most robust app, but the goal is for it to look and operate in a way that is clean and intuitive.

2) To practice planning and executing SOLID design principles, as well as reinforce the use of npm and webpack in my development.
